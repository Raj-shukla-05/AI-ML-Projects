# 🤖 AI & ML Projects

Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning portfolio!  
This repository showcases hands-on projects completed during my learning journey.

Each project solves a real-world problem using techniques from machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP — implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and more.
